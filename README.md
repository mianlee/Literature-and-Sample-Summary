# Literature-and-Sample-Summary


1. Genome-wide data from two early Neolithic East Asian individuals dating to 7700 years ago.

Genome-wide data from **two hunter-gatherers** from Devilâ€™s Gate, an early Neolithic cave site (dated to ~7.7 thousand years ago) located in East Asia, on the border between Russia and Korea.\

DevilsGate1, 0.059-fold coverage;

DevilsGate2, 0.023-fold coverage; 

and DevilsGate3, DevilsGate4, and DevilsGate5, <0.001-fold coverage.



Focus our analysis on the two samples with the highest sequencing coverage, **DevilsGate1** and **DevilsGate2**, both of which were **female**.
